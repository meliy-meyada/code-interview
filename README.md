| 1. | [Fixing async function error](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/code-interview/blob/main/Q01-coding-interviews-2022.md)| The original function ``thisIsSyncFunction`` is supposed to make a ``fetch`` request to a server and return the resulting data, but it is not working correctly because it is attempting to return the value of result before the value has been set. The first subquestion asks for the function to be corrected so that it correctly prints out the expected ``result`` of 100, and the second subquestion asks if it is possible to make the function truly synchronous so that the value of ``number1`` is available before it is used for the ``calculation`` on the next line. | 
| 2. | [Change CSS for dot, red box, and prevent overflow](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/code-interview/blob/main/Q02-coding-interviews-2022.md)| Modifications to be made to an HTML and CSS code snippet to change the dot's color, resize the red box, center the dot within the red box, and prevent the content from causing a vertical scrollbar. The suggested solution involves adding or modifying several CSS rules. |
