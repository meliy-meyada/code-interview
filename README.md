| 1. | [Fixing async function error](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/code-interview/blob/main/Q01-coding-interviews-2022.md)| The original function ``thisIsSyncFunction`` is supposed to make a ``fetch`` request to a server and return the resulting data, but it is not working correctly because it is attempting to return the value of result before the value has been set. The first subquestion asks for the function to be corrected so that it correctly prints out the expected ``result`` of 100, and the second subquestion asks if it is possible to make the function truly synchronous so that the value of ``number1`` is available before it is used for the ``calculation`` on the next line. |
