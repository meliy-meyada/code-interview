__List of Coding Problems from Programming Job interviews.__

| List | Link | Description |
|:--|:-----------|:------------------------------|
| 1. | [Fixing async function error](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/code-interview/blob/main/Q01-coding-interviews-2022.md)| The original function ``thisIsSyncFunction`` is supposed to make a ``fetch`` request to a server and return the resulting data, but it is not working correctly because it is attempting to return the value of result before the value has been set. The first subquestion asks for the function to be corrected so that it correctly prints out the expected ``result`` of 100, and the second subquestion asks if it is possible to make the function truly synchronous so that the value of ``number1`` is available before it is used for the ``calculation`` on the next line. | 
| 2. | [Change CSS for dot, red box, and prevent overflow](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/code-interview/blob/main/Q02-coding-interviews-2022.md)| Modifications to be made to an HTML and CSS code snippet to change the dot's color, resize the red box, center the dot within the red box, and prevent the content from causing a vertical scrollbar. The suggested solution involves adding or modifying several CSS rules. |
| 3. | [JavaScript Color Picker Implementation](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/code-interview/blob/main/Q03-coding-interviews-2022.md)| Write code that will display the text (an RGB code) from a button element in an "ANSWER" box when the button is clicked. The code should be efficient and performant. |  
| 4. | [Prevent Dialog Closing](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/code-interview/blob/main/Q04-coding-interviews-2022.md)| To prevent the dialog from closing when the user clicks the X button, you can add an event listener for the ``beforeunload`` event on the ``window`` object and use the ``preventDefault()`` method |
| 5. | [Create Angular Web App](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/code-interview/blob/main/Q05-coding-interviews-2022.md)| Web application that has three columns and includes an input field and a dropdown menu. The input field allows the user to enter a number, which is then used in a calculation chosen from the dropdown menu. The result of the calculation is displayed in the third column. The layout of the page includes a fixed width for the first and last columns, with the middle column filling the remaining space and having a minimum width. If the window is smaller than 600px, a scrollbar should be shown. The input field and dropdown are linked to component properties and the calculation is triggered when their values change. |
| 6. | [Create Angular web app Fetch data](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/code-interview/blob/main/Q06-coding-interviews-2022.md)| Creating a web application with Angular that filters and displays data from the ``https://api.publicapis.org/categories`` API in a table. The application should have an input field for filtering the results, and the table should be filtered based on the text entered by the user. |
